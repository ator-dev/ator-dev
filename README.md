### ator-developer

hey

I'm a student who loves software, people, and open source communities. Projects are vital to me, and I care about the code I write whether or not it contributes to my passions. Mark My Search is my first fully developed software, an extension built for research but useful in more ways than I dared to imagine.

My coding style may become oddly compact and padded with increasingly nested functional scopes, a symptom of fascination with logical flow. This is limited to personal experimentation; I adapt to the projects I adopt, and take feedback from differing experience.

I called myself ATOR after the first project I obsessed over, and see no reason to change. I still love the ideas that were part of the game, and perhaps someday will use them again.
